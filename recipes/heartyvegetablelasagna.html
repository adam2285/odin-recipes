    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>This hearty, vegetable lasagna is the only lasagna my husband will eat. We love it! Hope you all enjoy it as much as we do.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <l>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</l>
        <l>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</l>
        <l>1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</l>
        <l>¾ cup chopped green bell pepper</l>
        <l>¾ cup chopped onion</l>
        <l>3 cloves garlic, minced</l>
        <l>2 (26 ounce) jars pasta sauce</l>
        <l>1 teaspoon dried basil</l>
        <l>1 (15 ounce) container part-skim ricotta cheese</l>
        <l>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</l>
        <l>2 eggs</l>
        <l>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</l>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <l>Cook lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes, or until al dente. Rinse with cold water, and drain.</l>
        <l>Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add mushrooms, green peppers, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce and basil; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.</l>
        <l>While the sauce is simmering, mix together ricotta, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and eggs in a medium bowl.</l>
        <l>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</l>
        <l>Spread 1 cup cooked tomato and vegetable sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Lay down 1/2 of the lasagna noodles and layer 1/2 each of the ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese on top. Repeat layering again with noodles, ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese. Top with remaining 2 cups mozzarella.</l>
        <l>Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.</l>
    </ol>
